## Self-Study/Essay Questions

1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

describe() allows us to give human readable semantic descriptions of a given test suite and it() is for the tests themselves


2. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

TDD is a pattern of thinking about how an app will be tested before actually building it. To me the plus side is that it forces us to think about the actual functional requirements of an app in detail to create meaningful anticipation of failure and errors - this in turn helps to create better functioning apps.


3. Mention three types of automated tests.

Unit Testing, Integration Testing, and Regression Testing
